# Plastic Footprint

The purpose of this program is to help bring context to people about our own daily use of various plastic items.

The project starts on the browser page and initiates the logic through a button linked to the javascript file.

The program communicates with the user through the browser's prompt, asking for information on the weekly use of plastic items (such as waterbottles).

Once all the data is collected from the user, the alert window returns information on how much plastic was used for that item, by weight.  Also for context, it gives feedback on how much that would equate to if every person used the same amount.

Lastly, it returns the year that the plastic would be fully decomposed if placed in landfill this year.

## Notes

This project is partially complete.  To date, only water bottles have been added to the functionality.

The goal is to use images and graphics to represent the various sizes and quantities of the items.  Other items will be used and added together, such as:
- Single use straws
- Single use food storage like Ziplock bags
- Fast food / carryout containers
- Long term use items like Tupperware
- Household items made of plastic, such as shampoo bottles
- Dishes

Once these items are added, a high level view is possible of a person's plastic footprint.
